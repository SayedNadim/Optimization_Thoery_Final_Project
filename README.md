# Optimization Theory - class project

In this work, I have tried to use Harmony Search algorithm to colorize an image.To colorize, we need one color image and its grayscale image. The algorithm will intialize a fixed size of random  valued matrix and optimize the random values to match the color spaces.
This work is an on-going project.
