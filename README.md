# Optimization Theory - class project

In this work, I have tried to use Harmony Search algorithm to colorize an image.To colorize, we need one color image and its grayscale image. The algorithm will intialize a fixed size of random  valued matrix and optimize the random values to match the color spaces. <br>
I will update the final colorized image after rechecking everything. Currently the result is not good due to less iteration. Maybe I should reduce image size or initialize matrix more efficiently. Plus, the code is slow. Any contribution is welcome. <br>
This work is an on-going project.
